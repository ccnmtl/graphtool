An interactive graphing tool, using g.raphael, for exploring
relationships among datasets.  The tool allows you to add multiple
datasets onto a graph with a single (automatic) y-axis scale, and also
allows you to layer an arbitrary number of these graphs, with
different y-axis scales, on top of each other.  A variable can also be
chosen for the x-axis, to draw scatterplots.

This was built for the [Millennium Village Simulation](http://mvsim.com) at [CCNMTL](http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu).

You can try out a demo at [http://ejucovy.github.com/graphtool/sample.html](http://ejucovy.github.com/graphtool/sample.html).
